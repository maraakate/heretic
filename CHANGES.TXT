 - Added checks for statcopy to work for episode ends.

09-05-13
 - Raised MAX_BOSS_SPOTS and MAX_MACE_SPOTS from 8 to 32.

 - "-statcopy <filename.txt>" will make a file (or append to it) with the
   game statistics.  Works with all game modes.  If you do not specify a
   filename it will default to STATS.TXT.  I did my best to make sure it
   will default if not specified, but if you get some weirdness not
   remembering parameters or desyncing games because of missing params it's
   likely my checks aren't as good as I thought.
  - Fixed P_SetMessage "ultimate messages" value to be cleared on death
   and finish levels.  If you died and immediately respawned in a netgame
   messages would be disabled unless you reset the value in the menu or
   another "ultimate message" appeared.  In my stats testing I also found
   that if you saved in front of an exit and "GAME RESTORED" was still on
   the screen, flick the switch, messages again would be disabled.
   If you find other weird situations where it happens let me know.
  - New cheat "HHSCOTT" to immediately finish level.  Was originally for
   testing the statcopy function, but figured I'd leave it in.

09-03-13
 - Nothing crazy, but the game will tell you that you can't load games
   from older versions.

09-02-13
 - "-noexit" to disable exits in netgames.  Useful for DM maps.  Only works
   for valid netgames.  You can test it out with IPXSETUP.EXE -NODES 1
   -NOEXIT.
 - Had to shift the options menu up a bit since it was causing some glitches
   with the status bar.

09-01-13
 - Extended limits from wHeretic.  Should be able to play some larger maps
   from 1998-1999'ish.
   * MAXVISPLANES from 128 to 1024
   * MAXOPENINGS from SCREENWIDTH*64 to SCREENWIDTH*256
   * MAXDRAWSEGS from 256 to 1024
   * MAXVISSPRITES from 128 to 1024
   * Raised Save Game maximum file size from about ~196KB to ~1024KB(1MB)
   * Raised Save Game maximum string size from 24 to 256.
   * MAX_AMBIENT_SFX from 8 to 32.  Meant for allowing PC_LS.WAD to play.
     This could maybe cause issues on maps that are designed badly and have
     too many all fighting for sound space.  If you start getting weirdness
     with too many sounds and acting funky let me know and I will implement
     an alternative way to deal with the issue.

08-31-13
 - Added Headbob and Palette Flashing toggle to Options Menu.
 - "-cheats" parameter for coop cheating.  This CAN desync the game!
   Mainly useful for IDMUS changing.  But, try it out if you want.
 - "-noprecache" to skip precaching.
 - "-faststart" to disable the startup screen.  Also displays the older
   doom-style text output at startup.
 - "-novert" to disable mouse vertical movement.
 - HERESW.BAT to toggle between old and updated Heretic.

01-13-13
 - "Player died!" message in coop.
 - Startup screen alerts you if it is loading GUS patches into RAM.
 - "-nopalflash" and "-noheadbob" parameter.  Useful to pass from SETUP.EXE
   where it tends to delete these values.

01-12-13
 - New game rules in coop:
   * Players start with crossbow and 15 arrows.
   * Players keep weapons, inventory, etc. after respawn.
   * Keys are shared.

   for oneliner.

   * Torch lighting will last for the duration of the level.
   * Multiple artifacts will carry to the next level.
 - "-oldrules" parameter to use older game rules.

01-08-13
 - Added IDMUS cheat from Doom.  Changes music with IDMUSXY
   X being Episode, Y being Map.  i.e. IDMUS17 to play music from
   Episode 1, Map 7.
   Use 97, 98, and 99 to play the Intro, Intermission and Finale Songs.

10-01-12
 - Mouse sensitivity raised from 20 to 50.  Great for trackballs!
