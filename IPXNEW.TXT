Allows custom exes by passing -exe <filename.exe> to IPXNEW!
Increased argument string from 99 to 1024.  
Make some wild response files!

Ideas from CTFDOOM's IPXSETUP.

** How to use **

Allows players now to select which team they wish to play for.

    Teams
      1        Players 1(Green)  & 3(Brown)
      2        Players 2(Indigo) & 4(Red)

    This is extremely useful if you have a 4 player game setup with 2
computers in each room. Usually IPXDOOM will decide players numbers by
their network node address this parameter forces a player number into the
game.

NOTE : If "-player" is not used the original code is used.

eg.
   Lets assume we have a 4 player game set up without the "-player" parameter
   with two machines in each room.

   Room 1
   Player 1  (IPXDOOM Chooses the Player Numbers)
   Player 2

   Room 2
   Player 3
   Player 4

   Now seeing as the CTF implementation uses players 1 & 3 on one team and
   2 & 4 on the other, this really is NOT an ideal setup!


   To overcome this now is extremely easy :

   Room 1
   Player 1  IPXDOOM -player 1 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4
   Player 3  IPXDOOM -player 3 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4

   Room 2
   Player 2  IPXDOOM -player 2 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4
   Player 4  IPXDOOM -player 4 -ctf -file <mapname.WAD> -nodes 4


   Thats it!! Players are now set up the correct way!
