                               Last Updated: September 1992
                               ---------------------------

               This file contains  descriptions of the updates made to the
               Laughing Dog Screen Maker program since the first release in
               March 1992.

                                         LDOG.EXE
              --------------------------------------------------------------
          V1.01:
               --Internal release only.

          V1.02:
          20APR92 -- Fixed a bug in the PostScript output which caused the
               alternate PrCh function to fail. For consistency, all file and
               path names are now forcedto uppercase.

               --Fixed a bug introduced in V1.01 which prevented the PostScript
               option from working correctly.

          V1.10:
          25JUL92 -- Fixed a problem with the Set Last Screen Row dialog box
               that would sometimes cause the row number to increment more than
               one row at a time when using the mouse.

               --Initialize screen to White on Black ($0F) upon start-up.

               --Added ASCII Text output to the Generate Code/Export Menu. (See
               READ.ME file for more info on using this feature)

               --Added the ability to automatically insert WildCat! and PCBoard
               @variables into a screen using <cntl>-V hot key.(See READ.ME file
               for more info on using this feature)

               --Limited the length of screen rows exported as PCBoard or
               WildCat! BBS files to 79 chars. This change was necessary to
               avoid screens displaying a blank line between each row from
               within WildCat! and PCBoard on screens having a background color

               other than black. The last row on the screen (row 79) is now
               truncated.

               --Changed the colors used in the help screens.  People suffering
               from certain kinds of color blindness were having trouble seeing
               the green on black text, so the colors were changed to solve this
               problem.  If it is still difficult to see, please let me know and
               I will keep on adjusting until everyone can read the help
               screens. (Unfortunately, the colors are hard-coded into the help
               file, and cannot be user configured at this time).

          V1.11:
          14AUG92 -- Removed the invalid WildCat! BBS @variables @NODESTAT###@
               and @NODEUSER###@ from the WildCat! @Variable Menu.

          V1.12:
          02SEP92 -- Although still not "officially" supported, EGA and VGA
               extended screen modes (modes with more than the standard 25
               screen rows, like 35-line mode, 50-line mode, etc.) work better
               now.  Fixed the problem of the mouse cursor occasionally not
               being able to move beyond the 25th row.  Fixed the problem of
               getting multiple copies of a window, copied block, or BBS
               @variables showing up on the screen when using the Make a Window,
               Paste From File, or Insert BBS Variable features while UNDO was
               active. NOTE: In order for LDOG to work with these extended
               screen modes, the display must be in the mode prior to running
               LDOG.EXE, if you start LDOG in one mode then shell out to DOS and
               put the display in another mode, the screen will change, but LDOG
               will behave as though the original mode is still in effect, not a
               pretty sight...

          V1.13:
          Internal release only

          V1.14:
          25SEP92 -- Fixed a bug which caused the check mark to appear on the
               wrong line of the Generate Code Menu when toggling the "AS
               Monochrome" choice on and off.

               --Fixed a bug which sometimes caused the program not to return to
               the default drive and directory upon quitting if the program was
               executed through the DOS search path from another location on the
               hard drive.

               --When Copy to File is selected from the Block Menu, the default
               file name in the Save File dialog box now defaults to the last
               block file name saved or pasted.

               --Fixed a bug in the Color Pascal and Monochrome Assembly code
               generated which prevented it from running correctly on some XT
               computers with BIOS dates earlier than 1/10/86.

               --Added early binding to some functions in the PostScript code
               generated which could speed PostScript printing somewhat.

               --Added the "/#copies 1 def" variable definition to the
               PostScript code, which allows you to more efficiently print
               multiple copies of screens by changing the "1" to the number of
               copies you wish to print.

              --------------------------------------------------------------
                                       LDOGSHOW.EXE
              --------------------------------------------------------------
          V1.01:
          20APR92 -- Fixed the Copyright notice in the helpscreen

          V1.02:
          21JUL92 -- Program has not changed since V1.01, it was just recompiled
               with a different compiler.

          V1.03:
          03SEP92 -- Fixed the bug which prevented a single file with a filename
               beginning with a numeric character from being displayed.


              --------------------------------------------------------------
                                       LDOGRAB.EXE
              --------------------------------------------------------------
          V1.02:
          21JUL92 -- Fixed a problem which caused unexpected results if a screen
               being captured contained the characters with the values 0 or 255
               (which would have shown up as spaces on the application screen).
               These character values are now replaced with a normal space
               character (32 decimal/20 hex).

          --------------------------------------------------------------
                                       BLK2EPS.EXE
          --------------------------------------------------------------

          13APR92 -- Fixed a bug which caused the alternate PrCh function to
               fail. For consistency, all file and path names are now forced to
               uppercase.
